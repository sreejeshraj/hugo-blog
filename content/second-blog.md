At the end of the Cold War, the town of Borne Sulinowo suddenly appeared on the map in northwestern Poland.

One of the most secretive and important Soviet military bases in the Eastern bloc, it was outside of Polish control during the Cold War. Officially, it did not exist. First established by the Nazis, then taken over by the Soviets and rumoured to have hidden nuclear warheads, now Borne Sulinowo is home to over 5,000 people.
